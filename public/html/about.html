      <p>
        Rocky and Roxanne founded Get Straight Dog Catchers in 1972. Before starting the business, Rocky met Roxanne
        at the local saloon during an ultra-competitive dart throwing competition. Roxanne was impressed with Rocky's precision
        and they began brainstorming different uses for his accuracy - and that is how Get Straight Dog Catchers was established.
